Redis geospatial indexes let you store coordinates and search for them. This data structure is useful for finding nearby points within a given radius or bounding box.

Common example for applications that use Redis geospatial indexes:

* Store Locations: retrieve all the locations of a store in a given radius.
* Rideshare: retrieve where is the location of your driver.
